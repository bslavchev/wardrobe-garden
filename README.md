As I describe in my cover letter, I grew up deeply fascinated with agriculture, but always too far removed from it. My life never allowed me the space and time to actively participate in agriculture, but during the 2nd year of my Bachelor's, I discovered hydroponics and grow lights. Until then, I had always assumed that agriculture strictly requires sunlight and soil. Soil-less growing with artificial light eliminated all my practical constraints

Very shortly afterwards, half of the wardrobe of my student room had been converted into a hydroponic herb garden growing mint, basil and coriander. You may be wondering why inside the wardrobe - I quickly discovered that an appropriately-sized grow light is way more powerful than what I am comfortable with shining in my living space all day. I did not have an alternative space, nor a better way to separate the space than confining the garden to the inside of the wardrobe. When I was not home, I would leave the door of the wardrobe open to allow adequate air circulation - it likely wasn't enough, but it seemed to work.
