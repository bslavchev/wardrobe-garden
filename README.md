This repository exists primarily as an add-on to my application for the Data Scientist position at Source.ag

As I describe in my cover letter, I grew up deeply fascinated with agriculture, but always too far removed from it. My life never allowed me the space and time to actively participate in agriculture, but during the 2nd year of my Bachelor's, I discovered hydroponics and grow lights. Until then, I had always assumed that agriculture strictly requires sunlight and soil. Soil-less growing with artificial light eliminated all my practical constraints

Very shortly afterwards, half of the wardrobe of my student room had been converted into a hydroponic herb garden growing mint, basil and coriander. You may be wondering why inside the wardrobe - I quickly discovered that an appropriately-sized grow light is way more powerful than what I am comfortable with shining in my living space all day. I did not have an alternative space, nor a better way to separate the space than confining the garden to the inside of the wardrobe. When I was not home, I would leave the door of the wardrobe open to allow adequate air circulation - it likely wasn't enough, but it seemed to work:

Strangely, I don't have any photos of my coriander, but sucessfully growing that was my pride. I grew all my plants from cuttings from Albert Heijn plants, but the coriander plants had incredibly weak stems (I am presuming due to growing under insufficient light, leading to leggy stems), so usually the cutting would collapse and die. After maybe a dozen failed attempts, I finally found a way to stabilize one enough that it could root and strengthen its stem at least a little.

Unfortunately, my experiment only lasted half a year because I had to travel for an extended period and therefore I'd not be able to supervise the system. Even more unfortunately, I have not been able to repeat the experiment since as I simply haven't lived in an appropriate place for long enough. That being said, I have actually been looking at building a hydroponic system again, and I saw the job posting at Source.ag immediately after reading about what types of plastics are safest for me to use in building the system. This time, I think I'd like to put my DIY skills to the test and build a slightly more involved system.
